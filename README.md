# Wild Code School Nantes project 2 - BiclooApp

2nd project during training at the Wild Code School; our brief was to create a site with React using geodata from Nantes Metropole's public API in an interesting way.

My team of 5 developed an app to gameify Bicloo, Nantes' on-demand bike rental service.

We used React alongside Leaflet for dynamic map data display. We exceeded the project brief in the time allocated, adding authentication and user data storage using Firebase.
